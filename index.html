        <h2>Welcome Xperi & DTS Engineers.</h2>

        <p>Firstly, thank you very much for your time - I know you're all busy people.</p>

        <p>This experiment is about sound hierarchy.</p>

        <h3>WHAT WILL TAKING PART INVOLVE?</h3>

        <p> Taking part involves listening to ~100 sounds and rating them as either Background, Neutral or Foreground.</p>
        
        <p>This is not a forensic listening task - you won't have to detect barely noticeable artefacts.
            There is no wrong answer. I want your first impulse decision.</p>
        
        <p>The sounds are no longer than 5 seconds in length. You can listen to each sound as many times as you like.
            The experiment should take ~20 minutes to complete.</p>

        <p>You must be 18 or older to participate. Please listen to the sounds
            using headphones in a quiet environment.</p>

        <p>If you have any other questions, concerns, or want to know more about this research,
            please click the 'More Information' button.</p>

                <p>
                    My name is William Coleman and I am a PhD candidate in the School of Computer Science, 
                    Technological University Dublin, Ireland. Xperi/DTS sponsor my PhD in cooperation with 
                    the Irish Research Council. My research concerns sound hierarchy perception 
                    and how this may be used in audio content delivery.</p>

                <h3>WHAT WILL TAKING PART INVOLVE?</h3>

                <p>Taking part in this research will involve participating in a listening 
                    experiment. You will be played a series of sounds and asked for your response to 
                    them.</p>

                <p>There are no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ answers in this listening experiment – in other 
                    words it is not you that is under test. I am interested only in your responses 
                    to the sounds that I present.</p>

                <h3>DO I HAVE TO TAKE PART?</h3>

                <p>Although I naturally hope for your continued commitment to the listening 
                    experiment, you are free to opt out of it at any time without giving a reason 
                    and without prejudice.</p>

                <h3>WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF TAKING PART?</h3>

                <p>Completing the listening experiment will require between ~20 minutes of 
                    your time. During this period there is a low risk of being exposed to 
                    excessive sound levels. At all times you will have control over the volume 
                    level, though you will be asked to set it at the start of the experiment and not adjust 
                    it if possible.</p>

                <p>Participants with auditory disorders, such as tinnitus, may find that taking 
                    part in the study draws attention to their disorder in a negative way. In such 
                    an instance participants are asked to stop the listening experiment. None of the 
                    experimental procedures to be used in this study are likely to cause any 
                    discomfort or adverse reaction.</p>

                <p>As regards the benefits of taking part, you may find the experiment interesting 
                    and enjoy evaluating sounds and answering questions about your perception of 
                    them. Once the study is complete it will provide information on human 
                    perception of sounds and this may generally be of interest to audio 
                    professionals and academics.</p>

                <h3>WILL TAKING PART BE CONFIDENTIAL?</h3>
                <p>If you agree to take part, your participation in the study will be entirely 
                    confidential and anonymous. Any information collected will be held securely in accordance with 
                    DIT best practices.</p>

                <h3>WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?</h3>
                <p>The study will be prepared for presentation to academic journals and 
                    conferences. It will also form part of my PhD dissertation.</p>
