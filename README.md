# Crowdsourcing Labels
This is the website I implemented for a series of audio perceptual tests. Javascript, php and SQL are used to collect demographic data from participants, present sounds in controlled, randomly selected orders, record results and make then available for download.

NOTE: The files in /mp3_map include the random orders generated on random.org for the presentation and also the map that tracks the new randomised file names back to the original ESC and FreeSound ID numbers.

There are a total of 10166 mp3s prepared for this experiment. Stored on the imac at: Desktop/ESC_Stim_FINAL_1-10166
