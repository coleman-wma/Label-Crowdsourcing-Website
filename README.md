This is the website I implemented for a series of audio perceptual tests. Javascript & php are used to collect demographic data from participants, present sounds in controlled, randomly selected orders, record results and then post them to an SQL database on the backend.

The css folder contains files which control styling.

The js folder contains javascript files which control modal popups and things like audio file play progress bar and file loading.

The php folder contains php files which load pages and handle pulling information from an SQL table on the backend to control stimulus presentation order and posting participant ratings to a dedicated table on the backend.
